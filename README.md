# Grades

## Due: DoW MM/DD at 11:59 PM

## Part 1
- Create a program called `Grades.java`
- Prompt the user for a number grade 
- Print the letter grade based on what the user inputs
  - A: 90 <= x <= 100
  - B: 80 <= x < 90
  - C: 75 <= x < 80
  - D: 70 <= x < 75
  - F: x < 70
- Commit and push your changes

## Part 2
- Update `Grades.java` to make sure the number grade is in the range `0 <= x <= 100`
- If the grade is too small, output:
  - The number grade cannot be negative.
- If the grade is too large, output:
  - The number grade cannot be greater than 100.
- Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message
- Push your changes

## Part 3
- Update `Grades.java` to use only one if statement and no logical operators
  - You can use multiple else-if statements
- Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message
- Push your changes
